# Write a program that receives a set of English text and displays its translated text in Persian for us 


# =>Importing Libraries :
   Translator: This class is imported from the translate library. It is used to perform text translation from one language to another.
   Fore and init: These are imported from the colorama library. Fore is used to apply colored text in the terminal, while init (not used here) initializes the color settings for cross-platform compatibility.
   Subprocess: This library allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and retrieve their return codes. Here, itâ€™s used to execute a shell command.
   Fore.YELLOW and Fore.WHITE: These change the text color to yellow and white respectively for a more visually appealing prompt.
   
# => User Input :
  input: This function collects user input (a string of text) that the program will translate.
  Fore.YELLOW and Fore.WHITE: These change the text color to yellow and white respectively for a more visually appealing prompt.
